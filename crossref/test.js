          "<jats:p>The modern theory of complex systems changes our view of historical processes, accompanied by uncertainties, instabilities and ambiguities. The knowledge of this theory allows us to master a system or holistic thinking, and to understand the laws of functioning and growth of not just structural, but dynamic complexity. Uncertainties and chaotic elements that indicate any state of crisis are not only negative factors that we should beware of and not without fear to worry about them. We can learn to manage them and use them in the way of renewal of social systems, producing innovations. The strategic vision of complex systems evolution becomes an effective tool for decision making and scenarios planning based on our participatory activities with alternative futures. The article examines the case of Shell Corporation, which has been using scenario thinking technologies since the early 1970s, which has given it incredible competitive advantages and incentives for rapid growth and transformation into an international energy giant.</jats:p>",

The green economic recovery takes place with a leading role played by the energy industry. This paper focuses on the application and desired effects of green digital technologies in the electric power industry in ten countries \u2014 the largest electricity producers and consumers. The study is designed in the framework of the sectoral innovation systems concept. The research tasks were addressed, first, through horizon scanning (the analysis of research and analytical publications). Second, the green digitialization indicators for the electric power industry in the selected countries were identified with the use of statistical and other available reliable data and compared. Third, a comparative analysis of national strategic documents was performed, along with corporate tasks and indicators that reflect the digital transformation at micro level. As a result of the study, key trends and three models of green digitalization at the national level were identified, the prerequisites and potential social and economic effects of the application of these technologies in electric power industry were described.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>The transition to a circular economy is often associated with appropriate business models, which should, among other things, help to replace the conventional `end-of-life? concept regarding commodities with restoration and environmental design. This systemic change appears to be closely linked to the waste hierarchy: prevention of waste, reuse of old commodities and recycling of waste. The paper shows that there are various problems for businesses to maintain the waste hierarchy in the context of a circular economy. The intrinsic nature of environmental commodities and, in particular, societal path dependencies present some challenges. These societal path dependencies are related to the benefits of decentralized decision-making in a market economy. In the short term, appropriate environmental policies can help alleviate some of these problems, but in the long term, these societal path dependencies need to be reoriented. The paper contains practical examples of all the issues raised.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>This paper examines the structure and the relevance of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) consumption for different industries. The research is based upon the analysis of national input-output tables for European countries presented in the last release of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). The dataset allows for the identification of both the largest and the most intensive sectoral users of KIBS among different manufacturing, market services, and all other industries. The results confirm that the KIBS subsectors are very heterogeneous; patterns of consumption substantially differ across the six different types of KIBS that the data distinguish. It is suggested that these differences may be explained by the existence of specific synergies between each type of KIBS and some of the consuming industries.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>Identifying technology trends can be a key success factor for companies to be competitive and take advantage of technological trends before they occur. The companies always work to plan for future products and services. For that, it is important to turn to methods that are used for technology forecasting. These tools help the companies to define potential markets for innovative new products and services. This paper uses text mining techniques along with expert judgment to detect and analyze the near-term technology evolution trends in a Software as a Service (SaaS) case study.  The longer-term technology development trend in this case is forecasted by analyzing the gaps between science and technology. This paper contributes to the technology forecasting methodology and will be of interest to those in SaaS technology. Our findings reveal five trends in the technology: 1) virtual networking, 2) the hybrid cloud, 3) modeling methodologies, 4) mobile applications, and 5) web applications. Among the results achieved, we can summarize the interesting ones as follows: it is possible to say that traditional information systems are now evolving into online information systems. On the other hand, the use of a licensing model based on subscriptions triggers the change in perpetual licensing models. The product range that has evolved towards mobile technologies has put pressure on information storage technologies and has led to the search for new methods especially in the development of database systems.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>Rapid technological progress is one of the basic processes in the modern world. It is an integral part both in the field of labor and employment and in leisure and recreation. The request for an accelerated implementation of digital technologies in the economy and social sphere, which is inherent in one of the national development goals of the Russian Federation, makes this topic more important. In the presence of technological challenges, people have to adapt to constantly emerging innovations. Meanwhile the perception of innovations together with other individual characteristics and socioeconomic characteristics of different social groups could be considered determinants of openness to technological innovations. Based on this assumption, the authors of this article set the following objectives: they evaluate the openness of the population to innovation (through the construction of the index), examine the perception of innovation (by identifying factors of the perception of new technologies), and test the relationship between openness to innovation and the perception of new technologies. The multi-domain index of openness to innovation combines assessments of individual attitude, acceptance, and trust in innovations related to various spheres of the population\u2019s life. The perception of innovation is revealed through the Technology Acceptance Model and includes: perceived ease of use of new technologies; the perceived usefulness of new technologies; perceived security and reliability of new technologies; and perceived elitist features of new technologies. This study demonstrates that openness to innovation depends upon the perception of new technologies and is differentiated among population groups.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>Despite the accelerated dynamics of the environment, higher education institutions slowly update their curricula in entrepreneurship education according to global challenges and market needs. Moreover, knowledge and good practice exchanges between educators of futures studies, business representatives, and academics is limited. This article aims to present a methodology for prototyping an online course for individuals to become more future-oriented in their professional and personal settings. The main research problems tackled by the authors relate to: 1) the identification of competences that would help academics, entrepreneurs, and students to deal with uncertainty and to 2) convey the competences to the target groups through learning topics selected from futures studies and the entrepreneurship repertoire. The authors of the article undertook and coordinated theoretical and empirical research on foresight and Futures Literacy and its correspondence with entrepreneurship within the beFORE project funded under the Erasmus+ program\u2019s Knowledge Alliance scheme. The research process resulted in the identification of 12 key competence items and the development of a free, approximately 34-hour-long online course consisting of seven self-standing modules, 25 lessons, and 79 learning topics corresponding to these competences. The originality of the paper is in its contribution to the discussion on the competences and online course content that efficiently increase the capacities of using the future(s) in professional, academic, and personal settings.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>The main purpose of this publication is an attempt to treat phenomenon of uncertainty as the one of main research facility in future studies and not as the background for future research \u2014 by answering the following research question: \u201cWhat is the methodical relation among the scope of the uncertainty phenomenon vs. levels of knowledge and types of the future in the foresight approach?\u201d. The study uses the results of the analysis and criticism of the literature as the main research method. On this basis were performed deductive reasoning. Proposed by the author of the paper types of future and scope of uncertainty allowed to define the author\u2019s scale of knowledge levels. This paper has attempted to draw together three methodological fields: uncertainty, foresight, and knowledge. Author analysed complex relations among above areas on the basis of their characteristic which are author\u2019s extensions of existing concepts available in the literature. In the author\u2019s opinion conclusions from the results presented in the article can be a valuable contribution to the development of the area of management in the area of future management. In management of complex systems (such as Industry 4.0), from the foresight methodological point of view, it seems relevant to determine which specific uncertainties can be managed by which classes of foresight methods, and which foresight methods by what level of knowledge, will be appropriate for the analysis of a specific types of future. According to the author, the results of research presented in the publication may be used in creating research methodology of technological foresight projects and as a complementary element of research devoted to the issues of development of modern technologies, which include Industry 4.0.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>In the era of open innovation, the choice of a cooperative strategy is one of the most significant factors determining the effectiveness of innovation activities. The authors investigate typical configurations of cooperative networks in Russian manufacturing, including the choice of partners, the role of spatial distance, and the duration of joint projects. Using the firm-level data (1324 in 2015 and 545 in 2018) the paper estimates the role of cooperation in the innovation outcomes in terms of innovation novelty and export capacity.  The most common cooperative strategy is vertical cooperation that is the involvement of clients and suppliers in the process of innovation development. The geography of cooperation rarely extends beyond the region\u2019s borders and is mostly of an irregular (short-term) nature. A small number of enterprises that engage in international cooperation tend to rely on long-term linkages with academia, which is a distinctive feature of the most innovative Russian companies, including also those involved in the creation and distribution of intellectual property.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>Roadmapping has long been regarded as a practical tool for supporting decision-making for science and technology innovation and it has received recent attention for its potential use in responses to uncertainty. Indeed, roadmapping enables forward-looking strategy making and thus helps to reduce uncertainty. Accordingly, numerous studies have been conducted to propose new approaches to roadmapping for a wide range of contexts, including the data-driven and expert-based approaches. Although these two main approaches have distinct advantages and disadvantages, few previous studies have focused on how to integrate them into roadmapping to better support decision-making related to science and technology innovation. To address this research gap, this study investigated how to integrate data-driven approaches with expert insights during roadmapping. For this purpose, a workshop-based roadmapping method was combined with data-driven methods to test this approach in the context of technology planning for the automobile industry. An ethnographic approach was used to collect data on when, where, and how data analysis must be conducted to support experts\u2019 discussions. The research findings open a discussion regarding how to integrate data-driven methods with expert insights during roadmapping based on the trade-offs between the two types of data, that is, hard data for data-driven methods and soft data from expert insights, and suggest possible opportunities for future roadmapping developments.</jats:p>",

The search for information was carried out using the Internet, as a result 45 initiatives were discovered. The results show that the sector of entrepreneurship education is broad, but there are a large number of areas for improvement, in which universities can play an important role. In particular, this concerns elaborating and implementing a system for evaluating educational results, organizing monitoring of the effectiveness of such initiatives, including the analysis of success stories. In addition, a separate task is to expand the set of targeted programs for specific audiences (for example, unemployed), as well as to improve the content of such initiatives more deeply according to the specifics of the relevant target groups (for example, young mothers or older people).</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>The paper draws on evidence of predatory publishing obtained from the 4 year-long Harbingers research study of the changing scholarly communication attitudes and behaviour of early career researchers (ECRs). The project featured longitudinal interviews for its first 3 years with 116 ECRs researching science and social sciences who came from China, France, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, UK and USA. The interview data provided the building blocks for a questionnaire survey in the 4th year, which obtained 1600 responses from a global audience, which included arts and humanities ECRs and those from Russia. These studies investigated predatory publishing as part of general questioning about scholarly communications, in other words, in context. The main finding from the interview study were: 1) ECRs generally do not publish in predatory journals; 2) they only allude to them lightly and mainly in the context of open access publishing; 3) they no longer acquaint all open access publishing with predatory journals. The questionnaire found that, as in the case of the interviews, complaints that open access is low quality publishing are diminishing, however, this positivity has been partly offset by increased concerns about the dangers of predatory journals.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>In the context of technological and social changes, business faces the challenges of a more complex operating environment. New business models are required that take into account an unprecedentedly wide range of emerging factors. Among such approaches, an integral model stands out, which allows one to adapt to a new level of development of society and master a new context. The approaches to the development of an integral model are still in the process of formation, since a deeper study of the modern network society, its values, guidelines, and preferences is required. Taking into account such complexity requires non-linear approaches and thinking in terms of complex, dynamic systems. From this point of view, when interacting with the increasingly complex environment, it is advisable for companies to view themselves as an element of a large-scale system of horizontal, social ties, in which the idea of \u200b\u200bsocial responsibility acquires new meanings.  It is especially difficult to implement integral approaches within the framework of traditional thinking due to the variety and multi-layered factors that change the context of companies' activities. The transformation of corporate governance and approaches to social responsibility is a non-linear process driven by a chain of events related to changes in consumer behavior and other aspects. Such exponential changes are characterized by profound and cumulative consequences, radically changing the spheres of activity, social relations, and institutions. This article demonstrates the case of a company that, despite the difficulties, managed to implement a similar approach and maintain a dynamic pace of development.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>Knowledge-Intensive Business Services (KIBS) are problem-solvers for other organizations. The coronacrisis affects KIBS directly, but also means that their clients are confronting new problems. How are KIBS addressing these two sets of challenges? This paper draws on material available in the trade and industry press, on official reports and statistics, and the early academic studies addressing these themes. We find that KIBS have been active (alongside other organizations) in providing a substantial range of services aimed at helping their clients (and others) deal with various contingencies thrown up by the crisis. Not least among these is the need to conform to shifting regulatory frameworks, and requirements for longer-term resilience. KIBS themselves have had to adapt their working practices considerably, to reduce face-to-face interaction with clients and within teams collaborating on projects. Adaptation is easier for those whose tasks that are relatively standardized and codified, and it remains to be seen how far a shift to such activities - and away from the traditional office-based venues of activity - is retained as firms recover from the crisis. KIBS are liable to play an important role in this recovery from the crisis, and policymakers can mobilize their services. Some KIBS are liable to be critical for rendering economies more resilient in the face of future pandemics and we argue that these firms are also important for confronting the mounting climate crisis.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>The complication of the business environment, the growth of uncertainty, and the dynamics of change significantly affect strategic planning in business. Foresight research used in a company serves as a link between the volatility of the surrounding environment, possible expansion prospects, and an enterprise\u2019s strategy and tactics. Based on data from Poland, this article examines the main factors that determine the readiness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to navigate a variety of paths into the future (foresight maturity). This study uses an integrated approach, that integrates concepts of foresight maturity, dynamic capabilities, and corporate foresight. It relies upon a sample of over 500 Polish manufacturing SMEs, which is representative in terms of size, type, sector, and geography of activities. Using a 28-criteria assessment tool, it was found that the level of foresight maturity of a company most often depends on the size, type, and geographical coverage of markets. Involving stakeholders in the development of corporate strategies, scanning the micro- and macro-environment of the enterprise using a variety of information sources, improving skills in working with foresight tools as well as fostering other dynamic capabilities allow companies to gain lasting competitive advantages in a changing and unpredictable business landscape.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>This paper provides theoretical foundations for the existence of national social innovations systems (NSIS) and presents such a system with empirical data. Departing from the activities in France of Ashoka, a large and old service organization, which we label as knowledge-intensive social service (KISS), we build a large and robust social innovation network in France and argue that it represents a credible approximation of the country\u2019s NSIS. On this basis, we find differences within the national innovation system (NIS). Indeed, the core of the NSIS involves very few actors emanating from manufacturing or technology-intensive industries, and the coordination between actors seems more bottom-up than in the NIS.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>This paper proposes a knowledge co-creation roadmapping tool for knowledge creation in future-oriented discussions for members of competing firms with the aim of co-creatively envisioning the future of the industry. This approach adapts the roadmapping method to knowledge creation, thus building a communication infrastructure for discussing future plans beyond an organization (i.e., participants are from competing companies). Knowledge co-creation roadmapping could be commissioned to an open industry organization consisting of members sent by individual companies interested in overcoming obstacles to development. We put our method into practice with the subcommittee of the Engineering Advancement Association of Japan and set the subject as \u201cThe Future of Smart Social Infrastructure\u201d, a theme involving multiple stakeholders. We were able to draw up a vision of smart technology on the basis of the insights gained through the roadmapping activities. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of acquiring knowledge that could not be obtained by our own company or a single industry organization alone.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>This paper aims to empirically identify the characteristics and governance types of regional entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) associated with productive high-growth entrepreneurship (PHGE). We developed a unique database comprised of public statistics on high-growth enterprises and regional EEs in Poland over the course of 2011\u20132018. The Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components and a taxonomic analysis were used to identify how different types of EE governance relate to varying levels of high-growth enterprises\u2019 performance. We have identified and described the relationships between PHGE and diverse clusters of EE governance and evolution stages toward developed structures. Two clusters proved similarly effective in generating PHGE and they represent alternative EE governance solutions as well as the most advanced evolutionary phases. The proposed conceptualizations of productive high-growth entrepreneurship and EE governance types advance the understanding and measurement of these phenomena. The profiling and configurational approach adopted in this research reflects the heterogeneity of EE governance types and outcomes and can be further replicated in other research settings.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>Technological startups help to adapt to the global risks and allow one to track future trends. This paper identifies the main trends and birth factors of new high-tech companies in the Russian regions during 2013-2020. In 2020, fewer than 10,000 startups were created, this number has been steadily declining (by 40% since 2015), especially during the pandemic (-21%). Most of the startups are concentrated in Moscow, the Moscow region, St Petersburg, and the largest metropolitan areas. The share of the Leningrad, Belgorod, Kaliningrad, Lipetsk, Ulyanovsk, and Kaluga regions is growing due to the proactive policies of local authorities. Most startups are associated with knowledge-intensive services for business (B2B) and digital technologies. In 2020, their number increased in pharmaceuticals (about 100%) and in the production of medical devices (by about 30%).Based on the results of econometric analysis, start-up activity in Russia, analogous to countries with an established market economy, depends upon human capital concentration, market access, and a favorable business climate. Universities, through attracting students, especially those in STEM specialties, stimulate startup creation; although the share of university startups does not exceed one third of a percent. Budgetary and university expenditures on R&amp;D are ineffective in terms of creating new companies. The influence of development institutions on start-up activity was not found, while clusters and technology parks have a weak effect. The growth of startups is lower in regions with a predominance of large organizations, as well as in resource centers. The latter may be one of the manifestations of the \u201cresource curse\u201d. Startup activity is stable over time and depends on the situation in neighboring regions, which limits the chances to change the situation by means of entrepreneurship support policy. During the pandemic, start-up activity decreased minimally in regions with large metropolitan areas and a high level of education. Recommendations include tools for establishing a more balanced cross-regional situation by implementing the model of an entrepreneurial university, an expansion of start-ups\u2019 access to capital and markets, and the regionalization of entrepreneurship policies.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>The creation of effective innovation ecosystems (IES) at the national or sectoral level remains a difficult and not always feasible task. Basing on evidence from the Brazilian automotive industry, a case of unused opportunities for building a strong IES is considered. This is due to the insensitivity of such ecosystems to new complicated configurations and the formats of non-traditional interaction that they suggest - a \u201cnew ecology of competition\u201d, etc. The internal context of companies in relation to the practice of open innovation has been studied. Despite joint projects with close value chain partners, carmakers are showing a closed attitude to external collaboration, unlike players in industries such as aerospace or information and communications technology that gained growth and major transformation by building a broader IES. Only a high demand from the government for creating a strong IES can change the situation.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>The development of online communication platforms has given rise to the phenomenon of the gig economy. A new economic model that embraces a variety of forms of short-term employment is rapidly spreading around the world, becoming an everyday reality and transforming the labor market. The article analyzes the factors influencing the dynamics of this process and its main effects. Testing the main hypothesis showed that the development of technological infrastructure, despite its importance, does not fully explain the unevenness of the penetration of the gig economy and the variations in its impact upon different sectors, professions, and skill levels. Gig economy drivers are subject to further study, but already now we can state the need for targeted measures to adapt the economy to the new model, including retraining or creating alternative employment opportunities for \u201ctraditional\u201d workers giving up jobs in favor of gig-employed ones.</jats:p>",

The increasing complexity of social and economic development processes, accompanied by uncertainties, instabilities, unexpected turns, digitalization in the economy and the birth of Industry 4.0, the growing importance of network structures in business activity, new environmental standards associated with the need to switch to circular processes in the economy - all this requires changes in the management strategies of firms and corporations. Unconditional advantages are received by those firms that embed the principles of systemic, holistic, and non-linear thinking in their business philosophy.</jats:p>",

This study proposes to develop an overlapless maturity model that helps organizations deal with the aforementioned problems. The model was applied and evaluated by experts at five organizations. This approach was recognized as useful, complete, and helpful in a multi-framework implementation by problem management (PM) experts. This research provides contributions for academics since it distinguishes itself from the existing studies in the body of knowledge and is a baseline for further investigation.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>Apart from \u201cfuture-shaping\u201d tools (such as forecasting, scenario planning, etc.), many countries also use \u201cbackward-looking\u201d approaches to develop long-term strategies for switching to a new economic model. A retrospective assessment of accomplishments and failures (or policy learning, PL) helps learn lessons, and improve the effectiveness of innovation policy.  Using the example of Iran, the paper examines the use of PL to assess key initiatives in the field of science, technology, and innovation over the past two decades. Field research allowed to identify the main policy goals, analyse their evolution and the changes in the perception of previously made decisions by politicians themselves. The active use of technical and conceptual PL indicates a relative progress in adjusting the policy vector. At the same time partisan policy learning remains common, applied to legitimise the current course, which indicates insufficient maturity of Iran\u2019s political system (as is the case in many other developing countries). It is concluded that to make real progress and increase the effectiveness of innovation policy, technical, conceptual, and social PL should be applied, while keeping the use of partisan  policy learning at the minimum.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>This study analyzes the diffusion of battery electric vehicles (BEV) in the world and evaluates the vehicle charging stations based on the European Union (EU) scenario. Initially, the global BEV sales data from 2005 to 2018 are fitted with the two most frequently used econometric logistics and Bass diffusion models. Further, the study identifies the different stage adopters, forecasts the consumption of BEVs, and examines the velocity and acceleration of BEV diffusion. Finally, future charging stations are examined to meet the BEV sales demand. Results suggest that the adoption of BEVs demonstrates a better fit on the Bass model where the global BEV market is estimated to grow from 5,3 millions in 2019 to near 40 millions units by 2030, and with the reference of the EU countries\u2019 adoption scenario, the global charging stations will be increased from near 2 millions in 2019 to near 10 millions units by 2030.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected not only incumbent firms, but also the emergence of start-ups. This paper investigates and analyzes the pandemic\u2019s effect on new business formation, as well as business exits and insolvencies, in Germany. We find that the overall level of business registrations slightly decreased during the first year of the pandemic, but that the effect is specific to certain industries. Innovative manufacturing industries and technology-oriented services experienced an increase in the numbers of start-ups. High subsidies and a temporary suspension of important criteria obliging firms to declare insolvency weakened market selection resulting in fewer exits in 2020. The relaxation of insolvency regulations may lead to considerable numbers of \u2018zombie\u2019 firms. Generally, the pandemic re-enforced ongoing structural change, but also exerted specific effects that may be temporary in nature.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>As digitalization continues to fundamentally change professional work, we examine obstacles to technological innovation in the legal sector, which is a notable outlier when compared to other knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS). This paper aims to explain the lower engagement with technological novelty in legal services in contrast to other KIBS spearheading global innovation. We adopted a mixed-method approach, combining both deductive and inductive inferential modes in a pragmatic manner. We used a quantitative analysis of law firms (n = 258) to establish baseline observations that were used to understand the attitudes toward the use of technology in addition to interviews with individual lawyers (n = 28). The study broadens the understanding of obstacles to digital change in small law firms operating on the periphery of the global market. Six different barriers clustered in two groups were identified: three reflect the character of individual work, two are related to law firm performance, and the last reveals an overarching problem in technology design. The discussion extends the debate on technological disruption in legal services. The reluctance to adopt digital innovations is not irrational when the drawbacks of creative disruption are considered. Endogenous change would require altering fragmented structures of local markets for companies to grow via an economy of scale. It is more likely that digital novelties will continue to develop from the global market delimited by the English language. A better understanding of obstacles to technological innovation may serve lawyers, managers, and LegalTech providers with material concerns that need to be addressed.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>Creating and developing innovative business models (BM) is currently one of the key success factors for contemporary business. Rapid complex changes in the world reemphasize the need to better understand how BM can be successfully innovated in different markets. The digital component of BM innovation comes under a special spotlight, using the example of a company within the pharmaceutical industry. In particular, this study demonstrates how BM innovation can be developed and implemented in practice within the pharmaceutical market, which accelerates its digital transformation to increase the value it brings to the healthcare systems around the world while sustaining the ongoing crisis. In order to do that, the current paper offers a framework for BM innovation that defines BM elements, BM innovation aspects, and BM innovation logic. The study covers six markets that represent different value creation systems and mechanisms. This paper demonstrates how technological innovations can be activated using managerial tools and insights and also how they can be combined into the holistic system based on the needs of the key value chain actors.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>The subject of this study is the innovation market. To understand the laws of its functioning, this article introduces the concept of a technology frontier.  This is understood as the relative productivity of labor (relative to the technological leader \u2013 the United States), the achievement of which makes it justified for developing economies to move from large-scale borrowing of foreign new technologies to their development within the country. The purpose of the article is to determine the specified frontier, for which a simple econometric model based on international statistics for 61 countries is proposed. To improve the accuracy of the calculations, countries were clustered into two groups: advanced, for which the technology frontier has been crossed and their own developments of new technologies prevail, and developing, for which the problem of the technology frontier remains important. The current value of the technology frontier is in the region of 70% of labor productivity in the United States. The comparison with previous estimates shows that this value tends to increase, which creates additional difficulties for the transition of catching-up countries from the mode of borrowing to the mode of creating new technologies. Taking into account the technological frontier allows avoiding both an undue delay in the development of proprietary technologies as well as a premature transition to the creation of innovations while ignoring the possibilities of borrowing.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>Technology roadmapping has become an important foresight tool for science, technology, and innovation (STI) policy and technology strategy development. There are, however, challenges in translating evidence from foresight into the strategies of STI agencies and the planning of research &amp; technology development (RTD) organizations. While the foresight evaluation literature identifies methodological issues related to evidence granularity, scope, and stakeholder confidence, there is limited guidance on how to ensure roadmapping outputs are strategically relevant, appropriately detailed, and credible. This paper highlights the potential of using structured visual roadmapping frameworks to anticipate potential strategic foresight evidence failures and using the adaptive and iterative nature of roadmapping processes to address them. In this paper, we distinguish between: the roadmapping framework \u2018canvas\u2019; the foresight evidence captured on the canvas; the process of generating the evidence; and any final strategic plan developed using that evidence (with goals, milestones, actions, etc). We investigate efforts to use the roadmapping canvas as a research tool and diagnostic to explore emerging technology trajectories and innovation \u2018pathways\u2019. We demonstrate that key patterns of evidence distribution on the roadmapping canvas have the potential to reveal where further evidence may need to be gathered, or where further triangulation of stakeholder perspectives may be required. We argue that by adaptively addressing these patterns at key stages within the roadmapping process (and appropriately re-scoping, re-prioritizing, and re-focusing foresight effort and resources), the granularity, coverage, and consensus of the roadmapping evidence can be greatly enhanced. We conclude the paper by summarizing a set of novel principles for adaptive agile roadmapping, reflecting on the implications for foresight more generally, and outlining a future research agenda to test and refine this approach to agile foresight.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>The motives behind merger and acquisitions (M&amp;A) are often linked with the opportunities to obtain knowledge and technologies in order to enhance the competitive advantages of companies. In particular, the acquisition of digital technologies through mergers and acquisitions with ICT companies is especially relevant. However, the efficiency of such deals is often low and calls into question the implementation of digitalization strategies of companies. In this study we employ an approach for assessing the efficiency of M&amp;A deals with ICT companies by using the DEA method. Applying regression analysis, it was found that the high level of research and development expenses of acquirers can negatively impact the efficiency of the M&amp;A deals with ICT companies.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>Manufacturers face increased cost pressure and market volatility. Product life cycles are getting shorter. Production has to be faster and increasingly local. The acceleration of \u201ctime-to-market\u201d could happen thanks to the solutions of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), with supply chains morphing into highly adaptive networks with integrated entities. In this paper, we seek to exemplify the potential impact of I4.0 adoption on the competitiveness of the firms (being foreign subsidiaries among others) and ask about the nature of modernization as part of the global value chain in which the enterprise operates. Our research based on four case studies reveals that the competitive advantage of a firm could be modified in the era of Industry 4.0 as a result of a sector\u2019s transformation and changing relationships with partners. These findings correspond with the literature stressing the uncertainty and complexity of the digital economy in general, as well as difficulties with the precise measuring of the expected benefits. The fourth industrial revolution emphasizes \u201cthe race to the top\u201d giving priority to quality rather than cost reduction as a method of improving competitiveness and, since it implies the emergence of connected companies, truly linked with each other, the disappearance of clear boundaries between them.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>Information and communication technologies (ICT) which are transforming most areas develop non-linearly. Failure to take into account the nonlinear principles of complex dynamic systems hinders development of balanced innovation strategies. Companies and governments lose the ability to effectively respond to \u201cgrand challenges\u201d. The linear approach does not allow covering a wide range of critical areas simultaneously in the scope of Foresight projects, prevents from applying an interdisciplinary approach to developing innovation strategies, correct risks assessment, and making informed decisions. The paper proposes a solution: management based on \u201ccyber-physical systems\u201d (CPS) built on dynamic complexity and nonlinearity principles. Such systems not only integrate computing and physical action but are embedded in everyday environment; they are more than the sum of multiple intelligent computing devices. CPS transforms into collective social systems, integrate information, energy, and material flows, and adapt to physical processes. Cyber-physical systems can offer a sustainable information infrastructure which serves as a prerequisite for building up the innovation potential of a company, region, or country. They make it possible to analyse all stages of an innovation project from the technical and organisational points of view simultaneously, cover all possible social consequences and challenges, and identify unexpected promising developments. CPS have a decentralised structure which allows to solve complex problems and manage large and complex structures in real time, such as an energy grid, transport, smart city, healthcare, etc.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>Advanced Manufacturing (AM) markets are a major factor of contemporary worldwide growth that to a large extent determines countries\u2019 competitiveness. Strengthening and/or optimizing the positions on AM markets is among the major challenges for modern industrial policy. This article discusses the structure and dynamics of the development of advanced manufacturing markets, as well as the specifics of the policies of the countries strengthening their positions in these markets. Gaining entry into AM markets currently implies individual countries\u2019 and industries\u2019 adopting different models which combine a wide range of factors. Small nations are rapidly applying such approaches, gaining advantages and thus increasing their competitive edge, which creates certain challenges for leading high-tech countries too slow to adjust their industrial policies. So far the basis for Industry 4.0 markets is just emerging, and remains limited to a few nations including developing ones. Country cases are presented below to illustrate the development of AM markets.  The authors conclude that in the current context, no universal approaches to shaping a successful industrial policy remain. The most productive strategy is to combine the unique advantages of a particular economy.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>Small, medium, and micro enterprises make important contributions to economic growth and employment. Based on evidence from of the tire processing industry in Ecuador, this article assesses the development prospects for such companies in the context of the transition to a circular economy. The methodological basis of the study is scenario planning. Five scenario hypotheses are proposed and the probability of their implementation is estimated. The most optimal scenario (in which all five hypotheses are realized) is feasible and subject to a set of measures, including the development of new management and marketing tools, the involvement of universities and research centers in the creation of new low-cost waste processing technologies, and the organization of a special fund to support research and development in companies focused on the circular model.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>Every crisis affects entrepreneurial activity; for some entrepreneurs, it is an opportunity for a new start; others are forced to shut down their businesses. This study aimed to analyze the effect of the global coronavirus (so-called COVID-19) pandemic on Czech entrepreneurial activity. The article exploits the administrative data covering business demographics of seventy-seven Local Administrative Units (LAU1) regions over the years 2008-2020. Data were obtained from the Czech Statistical Office. The study provides insights into the short term effects of the pandemic, i.e. one year after. The results from the panel regression models and placebo tests comparing forecasted values of new businesses registrations and closures with actual values obtained after the end of 2020 do not show that there would be a significant drop in the Czech entrepreneurial activity. On the opposite, the data indicate that the Czech entrepreneurial activity grew and even increased compared with 2019. However, the obtained results need to be interpreted with caution, as many factors influenced Czech businesses\u2019 development. Specifically, we mention the past economic growth, the introduction of public entrepreneurship and SME policy instruments and financial back-ups of the business owners. There are several implications of the conducted research. For instance, there is a need to observe the long-term effects of the pandemic on business demography and its structure. We propose to study changes in bankruptcy rates in the most harmed sectors such as tourism, hospitality, culture or sport and compare them with sectors that could easier transfer their business activities online.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>The COVID-19 crisis has changed how firms and industries do business \u2013 at least for now. What is uncertain, however, is the duration of that change. Will the industry change induced by the COVID-19 crisis persist and, if so, for how long? Can a crisis, and particularly the COVID-19 crisis, act as a more permanent change agent and create an environment that mimics the entrepreneurial opportunity that industry forcing functions create? If yes, then there is cause to consider the entrepreneurial opportunity that the COVID-19 crisis provides. In this paper, we review the changes that the pandemic has brought to business practices. Furthermore, we discuss the differences between crisis-based opportunity and entrepreneurial opportunity created by industry forcing functions in order to illuminate the ability of a COVID-19 crisis\u2013induced Low Touch Economy to sustainably create entrepreneurial opportunities. We show examples and list the attributes of industry forcing functions that have already provided sustainable entrepreneurial opportunity. Then, we match these attributes with the factors pertaining to the COVID-19-related Low Touch Economy. We find that the COVID-19 crisis has similarities and differences to the traditional industry forcing functions started by disruptive technologies. However, unlike traditional industry forcing functions, the COVID-19 crisis acts in a pan-industrial manner, making the impact of the pandemic more profound. Furthermore, the timing of the pandemic is important too: the COVID-19 crisis struck during the emergence of a Schumpeterian wave of Industry 4.0 and accelerated the adoption of its most important harbingers. We provide researchers and practitioners a lens through which to review not only the COVID-19 crisis\u2019s possibility of lasting effects, but also how it will affect entrepreneurs.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>The goal of this paper is twofold: i) it provides a framework for the relationship between KIBS and public services, putting the role of service users at the center, and ii) new empirical evidence from a survey for which we test the impact that business services consultancies (KIBS) associated with the co-creation processes have upon the innovation of public services with methodologies such as co-creation (users\u2019 participation) and co-design (design laboratories) processes. The empirical evidence focuses upon the two aforementioned core business service methodologies to improve the quality of the public services provision. In this context, we test three main hypotheses regarding whether KIBS have a positive impact upon the innovation of public services and to what extent user-based methodologies are important. Data comes from the 2020 Co-VAL survey on public service innovation for Spain. The main conclusion is that KIBS have a higher impact upon public service innovation when users are taken into account through co-creation and co-design methods, acting as facilitators for co-innovation and network processes, than when KIBS is just acting on their own in bilateral relationships with the public sector. The overall positive effects do not mean that all uses of KIBS are always positive, for example, some KIBS consultancies subcontracting may have mixed results, but user-focused multiagent frameworks help promote positive impacts.</jats:p>",

          "<jats:p>The transition to a \u201cgreen\u201d economic model is a complex strategic task that requires a combination of two previously incompatible development vectors: maintaining dynamic economic growth and preserving the natural environment on a long-term basis. No country has yet been able to cope with such complexity, nevertheless, an active search for a new balanced model continues, with the development of appropriate strategies. China is among the countries moving in this direction. The article analyzes the influence of social, economic, and environmental factors on the prospects for the development of a green economy and the preservation of natural areas in China. The dynamics of changes in the ecological situation from 1970 to 2018 is investigated. The authors propose a methodology for assessing the state of the environment based on demographic dynamics, economic indicators, and the level of technological development. Over the past 50 years, China has experienced intensive industrial development, as a result of which the degradation of valuable natural assets is increasing in most regions. At the same time, efforts are being made in a number of provinces to remedy the situation through the formulation of new policies, the first results of which have been already visible. The government has established a new environmental legislation designed to scale the green practices of the pioneering regions throughout the country, including the trend toward the de-urbanization of individual megacities and others. The implementation of this strategy will be facilitated by the expansion of interdisciplinary scientific research, the development of complex technological solutions, and development programs that simultaneously take into account various factors.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>Third sector organizations, like the rest of the economic system, have been heavily affected by the pandemic. The aim of this work is to study resilience and adaptability to crisis in terms of economic results and innovative outcomes of the cooperative business model in the Italian third sector during the COVID pandemic. It uses new evidence from a recent survey on the Italian third sector and consists of two main parts. In the first, the institutionalist literature on contractual failures is assumed as an interpretative key in the comparison between the business model, governance, and routines in social cooperatives versus other non-profit organizations (NPOs) interpreted as third sector entities. In the second, we use the new data from a third sector survey in the Marche region, collected in the late spring of 2021 at the end of the pandemic outbreak. Empirical assumptions concern organizational resilience and adaptation to unexpected negative shocks in cooperatives and other NPOs. The results show that, in the management of the crisis, cooperatives are better able to preserve their human capital and resort to layoffs less often than other NPOs. Shared decision-making, employee involvement, and the adaptability of the work process emerge as dominant organizational characteristics that support resilience and service innovation in cooperatives. The main policy implication concerns the ability of cooperatives to play a stabilizing and a-cyclical role during the crisis and to fill the supply gaps left open by other organizational forms (private, non-profit and the public sector). The originality of the paper lies in its new approach to cooperative organization and in the analysis of the reaction of cooperatives to the pandemic.</jats:p>",

        abstract:
          "<jats:p>Foresight scenarios are not only useful presentational devices to show that many aspects of the future are open. Scenarios are means for generating advice that helps policymakers initiate actions in the present or near future that will be of long-term significance. Despite the influence that such advice may have on policy decisions, the Foresight literature has paid very little attention to the creation of policy recommendations. Though reports of scenario exercises frequently conclude with lists of recommendations that follow from the study, there is very little explication of the process whereby advice is elicited from the examination of these future scenarios. This paper addresses this gap, examining how the generation of recommendations is related to the development of scenarios within multiple future repositioning workshop settings. It focuses on the fluency and originality of these recommendations, and how this is influenced by repositioning participants in highly transformational scenarios. Repositioning is the process whereby participants are invited to imagine themselves playing roles in hypothetical future contexts, and on that basis to make decisions or devise strategies as if they actually were immersed in these circumstances. The method proposed and the findings of the case study have implications for why and how this future repositioning approach can be incorporated as a \u2018key feature\u2019 in the design of Foresight activities. The aim is also to raise awareness of the need for more exploration of Foresight recommendation methodology.</jats:p>",
